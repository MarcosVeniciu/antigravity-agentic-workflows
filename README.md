## 🎯 The Pitch (Why Antigravity?)

Working with LLMs on large codebases frequently results in the "trigger-happy" problem: the AI tries to refactor entire files before understanding the context, causing regressions and knowledge loss.

The **Antigravity IDE Ecosystem** solves this by enforcing a **Strict State Machine Architecture**, **Ephemeral Chat Windows**, and deep integration with a **"Second Brain"** (Obsidian Vault via MCP).

Each AI agent has restricted permissions and an isolated scope — from requirements engineering (BDD/SDD) and living DoD logs, through iterative TDD pipelines and diff-scoped Refactoring, down to OWASP-aligned Code Review, atomic documentation, and release management.

**The principle is absolute: AI suggests, human orchestrates and approves.**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (5-Minute Quick Setup)

### 1. Prerequisites
* An IDE compatible with the Antigravity ecosystem (e.g., local Gemini/Claude setup).
* The **Obsidian** app installed locally (for project Knowledge Graph).

### 2. Installation (Automated Setup)

Clone the repository (or download and extract the ZIP file):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcosVeniciu/antigravity-agentic-workflows.git
cd antigravity-agentic-workflows
```

Run the automated installer for your operating system:

#### 🪟 Windows
* **1-Click**: Double-click `install.bat` in File Explorer.
* **PowerShell (Interactive Menu)**:
  ```powershell
  .\install.ps1
  ```
  *(Options: `[1] Global`, `[2] Project`, `[3] Restore Backup`, `[4] Uninstall`, `[5] Exit`)*
* **PowerShell (Direct CLI)**:
  ```powershell
  # Global install (~/.gemini)
  .\install.ps1 -Global

  # Specific project install (.agents/)
  .\install.ps1 -Project "C:\Path\To\YourProject"

  # Restore / Rollback to a previous snapshot
  .\install.ps1 -Restore

  # Uninstall workflows, skills and rules cleanly
  .\install.ps1 -Uninstall
  ```

#### 🐧 Linux & 🍎 macOS
```bash
# Make executable and run interactive menu:
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Or direct CLI flags:
./install.sh --global
./install.sh --project "/path/to/your/project"
./install.sh --restore
./install.sh --uninstall
```

> [!TIP]
> **Safety, Backups, Rollback & Uninstall**:
> * **Transaction Manifest (`manifest.json`)**: Every installation records both modified and newly added files. When rolling back a fresh install, all newly added files are deleted cleanly, restoring the environment to a 100% clean state.
> * **Rollback**: Access previous snapshots via menu option `[3] Restore Backup` or `.\install.ps1 -Restore` / `./install.sh --restore`.
> * **Uninstall**: Cleanly remove installed resources via option `[4] Uninstall` or `.\install.ps1 -Uninstall` / `./install.sh --uninstall`. A safety backup is always created automatically prior to removal.
> * **Dry-Run**: Append `--dry-run` (or `-DryRun`) to any command to preview operations without modifying files on disk.

### 3. Engaging the "Second Brain"
1. Open Obsidian.
2. Open your project's vault folder.
3. Enable the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to connect the knowledge base to the AI.

### 4. First Run
Start your workflow by consulting project context or planning a new feature:

```bash
# Consult the Oracle (Read-Only Context)
/ask Explain how the current microservices architecture is designed.

# Start the Development Cycle (BDD & Requirements)
/plan
```

## 🏗️ Agent & Skill Architecture

The ecosystem adopts a **modular two-layer decoupled architecture**:

1. **State Routers (`workflows/`)**: Lightweight playbooks defining agent persona, strict constraints, success evidence, and transition gates (**[NEXT STEP]**).
2. **Modular Skills (`skills/`)**: Operational procedures, automation scripts, templates, and reference manuals injected on-demand into AI context via Progressive Disclosure.
3. **Living Execution Log & DoD (`01-concepcao/dod-[slug].md`)**: Dynamic document centralizing development timeline history and gating functional acceptance criteria, non-functional rules, audits, and releases.

> [!NOTE]
> **Source / Matrix Repository**: The `workflows/`, `skills/`, and `prompts/` directories in this repository represent the **development matrix** of the ecosystem. When deployed globally to the developer's environment, they are installed in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.gemini/config/global_workflows/`, and `~/.gemini/config/skills/` (or `<project>/.agents/` and `<project>/GEMINI.md` inside workspaces).

## ⚡ Workflow Optimizations & Technical Rationale

1. **Diff-Scoped Efficient Refactoring (Phase 3)**:
   - Refactoring takes place in its own dedicated consolidation phase (Phase 3), executed strictly on a 100% green test suite (*Make it Right*).
   - Analysis and refactoring scope is **strictly limited to files modified on the active branch** (`git diff develop...HEAD --name-only`), eliminating token waste and the risk of regressions in untouched legacy code.

2. **Phase 2 (`/implement`) Autonomy & Micro-Checkpoints**:
   - Phase 2 (`/implement`) manages the entire TDD cycle (Red ➔ Green) divided into dependent context batches (`skills/tdd-plan`, `skills/tdd-tests`, `skills/tdd-code`).
   - For every completed green batch, a local micro-checkpoint (`git commit`) is recorded and the timeline in `dod-[slug].md` is updated.

3. **Living Tracking Artifact (`01-concepcao/dod-[slug].md`)**:
   - Centralizes development timeline history and the Definition of Done (DoD) with functional, non-functional, audit, and release checklists.
   - Acts as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for objective gating before authorizing versioning and merges.

4. **Domain-Specialized Audits (Phase 4)**:
   - `/review` decomposes analysis into 5 atomic audits executed directly on the git diff: Architecture, Security (OWASP Top 10/ASVS), Quality (AST $V(G) \le 10$), Performance, and Resilience.

5. **Reactive Debugger Support (`/test-fix`)**:
   - `/test-fix` provides surgical debugging support if tests fail during implementation (`/implement`) or refactoring (`/refactor`), isolating root cause in 1 sentence and applying minimal fixes to production code.
